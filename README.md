# 🧮 Truth Table Generator (C)

This project implements a **logic circuit simulator** in C that generates truth tables for various logic gates and circuits.  
It demonstrates low-level programming concepts such as **bitwise operations, file I/O, and dynamic evaluation of logic circuits**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Supports common logic gates:
  - AND, OR, NOT, XOR  
  - Multiplexer (MUX)  
  - Decoder  
- Evaluates truth tables for custom circuits  
- File I/O for reading logical expressions and writing results  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C  
- **Tools:** GCC, Make, GDB (for debugging)  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o truth_table

2. Run with an input file:

./truth_table input.txt


📂 Example

    Input (input.txt):

    A B | AND
    0 0 | 0
    0 1 | 0
    1 0 | 0
    1 1 | 1



Output:

    Truth Table generated successfully
